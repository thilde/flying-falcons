# ARC Repository Example
Example Github Repository for ARC Autonomous Portion

File structure must be of the following:
- Code: Contains any code that teams produce outside of any modifications amde to main.py is to be run by judges
- Supporting Material: Anything that can help judges understand what code is doing, whether that is notes, reports, etc.

In the code folder, there is one file: waypoint_class.py which contains supporting code for teams to interact with waypoint information. Teams must NOT modify main.py except areas that are denoted (importing functions, etc.) and are only allowed to use libraries that are imported there.

Files of interest:

Main.py:
- This will be the script that will be run by the judges. Libraries that are available to teams are imported there in main.py. Teams can modify areas not marked as "DO NOT EDIT", and teams will be penalized if those portions are modified. To run example, uncomment line 144 to a simple box flying routine.
